# React Challenges

## Welcome!

React Challenges give you goals to exercise your React skills on. Each challenge has a set of requirements, is intentionally somewhat vague. You get decide what exactly to build and how to build it while meeting the requirements.

You will find the challenges as issues marked **Challenge**.

Starter projects are provided in the <code>/starter-projects</code> folder.

Possible answers to some of the challenges are in the <code>/possible-answers</code> folder. Look here if you need to but only after you have struggled on your own.
